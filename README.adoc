= Jenkins/Git Webhook/Polling Proxy

This piece implements (1) a webhook server to record Github Commit/PR callbacks, and (2) a
polling script triggerning Jenkins build jobs.

== Use Case/Concept

Given a Jenkins server that has no Internet-facing REST-API, polling is the next option to
automatically trigger build jobs. However, the polling overhead could grow and could run into
timeing issues because of

 - A large number of repositories, branches
 - Multiple event types (commit, PR)
 - Short polling intervals
 - Multiple Jenkins servers (central + local dev, customer-site QA instances)

To reduce the communication overhead between Jenkins and Github the webhook proxy
will collect the events in a single data structure that can be fetched with a single GET request.

The polling script will check for new events and trigger Jenkins builds accordingly.

== Webhook Proxy

The webhook proxy will store the JSON data received from each POST request in a owner/repo/branch
path, overwriting previous events for the same repo. After each call it will (re-)create a persistent
(JSON) dictionary containing the most recent event for each owner/repo/branch. This status page can
be read from /status at the proxy web server.

Authentication: configure a secret path (e.g. 16 char random string) for GET and POST operations.


== Polling Script

The polling script trigger_jenkins.py will compare the status page with the previous version. If there is a different
entry for a owner/repo/branch, it will trigger a build.

Note: Currently there is no check for already running builds.
